# Images to Single PDF

What if you get a set of images?
Instead of sending them as multiple image attachment,
why not combine them and send as a single PDF?

## Usage

Put your image files in a dir, e.g. `{input}`.
Run

```
./images-to-single-pdf.sh {input}
```

Then you will see the result `{input}.pdf`.

**Note: The pages are ordered according to filenames.**
